- **Problem Type:** Binary Classification

## Tech Stack

- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Flask for deployment
- Docker, GitHub Actions, Heroku, AWS SageMaker, Kubernetes

## Workflow

1. Data exploration and modeling in Jupyter
2. Model saved as `.pkl`
3. Deployment with Flask
4. Containerized using Docker
5. Deployed to Heroku with CI/CD
6. Re-deployed on AWS SageMaker
7. Final deployment on Kubernetes
